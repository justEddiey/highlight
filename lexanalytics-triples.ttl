    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  At the lower Court, the Appellants as plaintiffs, had sought, among other reliefs, the following: “(a)A declaration that the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW/581/2007delivered by Hon. Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, was obtained by fraud. (b) An order setting aside the judgment of this Honourable Court in Suit No. HOW/581/2007, delivered by Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha on October 26, 2009, which was obtained by fraud.  Alternatively to A & B; An Order setting aside the part of the judgment of Honourable Justice N.B. Ukoha which awarded to the claimant in suit NO.HOW/581/2007 in the sum of N28,516,680.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred and Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty Naira) as special damages for Nigerian treatment and the sum of 108,00.000 (sic) Lakh for her overseas treatment for having been obtained by fraud. (c) An Order for refund of the sum of N62,924,608.00 (Sixty Two Million, Nine Hundred and Twenty- Four Thousand, Six Hundred and Eight Naira) deposited in the Registry of the Court of Appeal, including interest accrued thereon. (d) An Order awarding special damages to the claimants.” (Page 13 of the Records). The summary of Appellants’ claim at the Court below was that some of the receipts tendered by the Respondent (as claimant in Suit No. HOW/581/2007) were procured by fraud/forgery. Therefore, since those receipts which were obtained by fraud/forgery were the basis of the trial Court’s award of special damages in favour of the Respondent, those damages awarded by the trial Court in its judgment should be set aside for the obvious fraud.  The Respondent was served the originating processes of this suit (How/806/2012) and instead of filing a defence to contradict the allegations of the Appellant that some receipts relied upon by the trial Court were obtained by fraud/forgery, the Respondent filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated 22nd January, 2018, challenging, in limine, the jurisdiction of the lower Court to adjudicate over the Suit. The ground of the Preliminary Objection was that the issue whether the lower Court’s judgment was based on the issue of fraud/forgery had been determined by the Court of Appeal in its interlocutory ruling (on an interlocutory application filed by the Appellants) in CA/OW/146/2010, on 28/3/2013 and so was defeated by the doctrine of Res Judicata. -" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  This Appeal is against the judgment of Imo State High Court in Suit No. HOW/98/2007, delivered on 11th March, 2013, by Hon.  Justice Ngozi Opara, wherein the trial Court gave judgment to the Claimants (now Respondents). The trial Court had earlier on 23/5/2011 granted an order of Interlocutory Injunction in favour of the Claimants, affirming the order of renewal of the originating process, which the Appellant had challenged as having expired 3 years before the Respondents sought an order for its renewal. Appellant filed this Notice of Appeal on 20/3/13 against both the said interlocutory decision and the final judgment.  At the Lower Court, the Respondents (as Claimants) had sought: (1) Declaration that the Claimants are entitled to the Statutory Right of Occupancy over the land known as UZO AMAKOHIA EGBELU UMUIMEKA, or Plot 199 Works Layout, Owerri, Imo State. (2) The sum of N10,000,000 (Ten Million Naira) damages for trespass. (3) Perpetual Injunction restraining the defendant, his privies, agents, workers and servants from further trespass on the land of the Claimants.-" ;

I have seen in recent time that parties who have bad cases embrace and make use of the constitutional provisions of fair hearing to bamboozle the adverse party and the Court, with a view to moving the Court away from the live issues in litigation. They make so much weather and sing the familiar song that the constitutional provision is violated or contravened. They do not stop there. They raise the defence in the most inappropriate cases because they have nothing to canvas in favour of their case. The fair hearing provisions in the Constitution is the machinery or locomotive of justice, not a spare part to propel or invigorate the case of the user. It is not a casual principle of law available to a party to be picked up at will in a case and force the Court to apply it to his advantage. On the contrary, it is a formidable and fundamental provision available to a party who is really denied fair hearing because he was not heard or that he was not properly heard in the case. Let the litigants who have nothing useful to advocate in favour of their cases leave the fair hearing constitutional provision alone because it is not available to them just for the asking.”[Adebayo v. A. G., Ogun State (2008) 7 NWLR (Pt. 1085) 201] “Counsel, quite a legion, find the fair hearing principle duly entrenched in the Constitution as a pathway to success whenever they are in trouble on the merit of the case before the Court. Some resort to it as if it is a magic wand to cure all ills of the litigation. A good number of counsel resort to the principle even when it is inapplicable in the case. The Constitutional principle of fair hearing is for both parties in litigation. It is not only for one of the parties. In other words, fair hearing is not a one-way but a two-way traffic in the sense that it must satisfy a double carriage-way, in the context of both the plaintiff and the defendant or both the appellant and the respondent. The Court must not invoke the principle in favour of one of the parties to the disadvantage of the other party undeservedly. The fair hearing principle formerly entrenched in Section 33 of the 1979 Constitution, and now Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution, is not for the weakling, the slumberer, the indolent or the lazy litigant, but it is for the party who is alive and kicking in the judicial process by taking advantage of the principle at the appropriate time. The principle is not available to a party who sets a trap in the litigation process against the Court and accuse the Court of assumed wrong doing even when such so-called wrong doing is, as a matter of fact, propelled or instigated by the party, through his Counsel.” Per NIKI TOBI JC, Newswatch Comm. Ltd. v. Atta (2006) 4 SC (Pt. II) 114, (2006) 12 NWLR (Pt. 993) 144-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  At the Court below, the Applicants (2nd set of Respondents herein) had sought, among others, the following reliefs against the Respondents (now Appellant and the 1st set of the Respondents): a) An order of the Honourable Court restraining the 2nd to 6th Respondents, officers, men and operatives of their respective commands from arresting, harassing or detaining the Applicants at the prompting or instigation of the 1st Respondent, pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice. b) And for such further or other orders as this Hon. Court shall deem fit to make in the circumstances. The grounds for the application, also shown in the supporting affidavit, showed that on 13/8/2004, the 6th Respondent (Mr. C. Imo) Officer-in-charge, Command Surveillance, Owerri, in company of the 5th Respondent (D.P.O. Mgbidi) and other policemen, heavily armed came to the palace to arrest Applicants, but because they did not see Applicants, they dropped invitation letters at the palace (Exhibits A, B, C & D) for Applicants to report at the Police Station - Command office Appellants said that the attempt by 2nd to 6th Respondents to arrest them, resulted in their being trailed by the police, all on the instigation of the 1st Respondent, upon a phantom allegation stated in the Exhibits A to D - namely, threat to life. But on 4/7/2014 Applicants filed Notice of Discontinuance of the Suit and followed up with a Motion on Notice on 10/9/14, seeking the order of Court for leave to Applicants to discontinue the Suit against all the Respondents. That was in reaction to the 1st Respondent’s application to strike out the suit. See pages 65 to 70 of the Records of Appeal. Surprisingly, the Trial Court heard the application to withdraw the suit and refused the same, ordering the parties to proceed with the suit.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant/Plaintiff was the 1st son of late Oji Anya. The original 1st Respondent, was his mother (as well as those of the other parties) as well as the surviving wife of the said late Oji Anya (but she died during the pendency of the appeal at the Court of Appeal).  After the death of late Oji Anya, his immediate family believing he died intestate, held several meetings to distribute his estate among them. However, after commencing the process of obtaining Letters of Administration from the Probate Registry of the High Court, Umuahia, problem ensued as to the entitlement of the parties to the said estate and whether the female children of the family should receive any portion. The extended family intervened and it was resolved that an equitable formula for the distribution be adopted. Thereupon, the original 1st Respondent (now deceased wife/mother) rejected the resolution and alleged that the deceased left a Will prepared by one Clement H. C. Nwanya, Esq., appointing her and Mr. Nwanya as Executors of  two (2) buildings forming part of the estate.  The Appellant/Plaintiff therefore brought a suit seeking, among others -  1. A declaration that the late Chief Oji Uke Anya died intestate; and that the document purporting to be the will and the last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya is void and of no effect whatsoever. 2. A declaration that the estate of Chief Oji Uke Anya is to be distributed in accordance with the custom of inheritance of Igbere people of Abia State of Nigeria. d. A perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from acting or purporting to act as Executors of the said purported will and last testament of Chief Oji Uke Anya; and an order directing the defendant to render an account unto the plaintiff of all monies collected by them as rent from 2 buildings in the estate located at Uwani Enugu State.  The Respondents counter-claimed and defended. The trial Court gave judgment in favour of the Respondents, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary " FACTS AND CLAIMS  The claims of the Respondent/Plaintiff before the trial Upper Area Court were for:- “a) The sum of N1,670,000 being the outstanding balance remaining unpaid from the hire and use of the Plaintiffs two (2) construction machines. b) 10% interest on the judgment sum. The evidence of the Respondent/Plaintiff showed that the 1st Appellant went to the Respondent and hired an excavator and a grader. The grader was hired for 12 days at N80,000 per day bringing the total money payable to N960,000. The excavator was hired at N110,000 per day for 11 days which totaled N1,120,000. The total sum, therefore payable, was N2,170,000.00. The 1st Appellant paid to the Respondent N500,000, leaving the unpaid balance of N1,670,000.00. The other complain of the Appellant is that while the Respondent as PW1 stated that the name of the site engineer is Isaac, he called one Engineer Robinson Isaiah (page 14-15 of the record) with no explanation as to the two names. That PW1 also stated at pages 12-13 of the printed record that “besides this work which we did on credit there are other previous works which we did. I can’t remember how much was paid for the previous work we did for him. This was in 2012 but I can’t remember the money paid”. According to Counsel, these are material contradictions that go to the root of the Respondents' claim before the trial of the Upper Area Court which it did not advert its mind to. The claim of the Plaintiff/Respondent was for services of machinery hired by the Defendant/Appellant which has not been settled for and it was argued that evidence was led as to the claims of the Respondent upon which the trial Court entered judgment in favour of the Respondent.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  Both parties are companies incorporated in Nigeria which primary operations fall under the legislative domains of the National Assembly to wit: business of Design Engineering/construction in the Hydrocarbon Oil/Gas Sector in Nigeria and Natural Hydrocarbon Gas exploitation, transmission, management, distribution and sales respectively. Their operations, therefore, prima facie seems to fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. However, the dispute disclosed in the Appellant/Plaintiff writ was that of a simple contract for the design and construction of subsurface and Submarine Natural Gas Pipeline for transmission and distribution of Natural Gas to Agbara and Ota, which contract had an effective date of commencement of 15th March, 2000 and a scheduled completion date of 20th October, 2000. During the execution of the contract, the appellant claimed that he incurred additional expenditures with the knowledge of the respondent. Even though the respondent made substantial payment to the appellant, misunderstanding ensued between them which led to the issuing of a letter of termination of the contract on the 4th of December, 2001 by the respondent.  The appellant, aggrieved by the termination of the contract took out a writ of summons and a statement of claim at the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, in which it claimed special damages, N2 billion in general damages for loss of goodwill, business prospects, sub-contractors, and staff loyalty, bankers confidences for failure to keep to scheduled loan repayment obligations, equipment deterioration etc., among other reliefs.  The trial court (Federal High Court, Lagos, Okeke J.), granted all the reliefs sought by the appellant and dismissed respondents counter claims. Court of Appeal (Lagos Division) heard the appeal of the Respondents during which, for the first time, Respondents raised the issue of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. After extensive analysis of Section 251(1)(n) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and references to decided cases, the lower Court came to conclusion that the trial Federal High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear, and determine the appellants claims which were based on simple contract. The respondents’ appeal was allowed and by virtue of Section 24(2) of the Federal High Court Act and further, by the authority of Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the lower Court transferred the ease to the Lagos State High Court as a judicial forum with the requisite jurisdiction, to hear and determine the case.-" ;

(d) Interest on the judgment sum at the rate of 10% per annum until final payment thereof. The claim arose because the Claimant, operated a current account with the Appellant/Defendant bank and while the said account was still in credit, he issued a cheque in favour of a third party, which was presented for payment to the bank. However, the cheque was returned unpaid with the words “ACCOUNT CLOSED” endorsed on it. It was the contention of the respondent that the said endorsement on the cheque was not only a breach of contract but also libelous having been published to the third party and the staff of the UBA Plc when in fact he was not given notice of any such closure of his account with the appellant.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Respondent who was the plaintiff before the trial Court claimed to have purchased plots of land in dispute at a place described as Alidawari village in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State in 2003 and 2004 at a cost of N20,000.00 and N40,000.00 respectively from Alhaji Audu. He also claimed to have farmed on the land for 5 years. Then Respondent put a third party named Lawan Musa on the land to farm on it for about two years after which the land was handed back to the Respondent. When militant insurgency broke out in Borno State, claimant left the farm land with intent to resume farming when relative peace returned. However, when he came back to clear the said land for farming, he noticed the appellant trespassing into the land by demarcating it into various plots. When challenged, the appellant refused to yield and leave the land.  On his part the Defendant/Appellant asserted that he inherited the farm land from his father. However, his father never told him that he purchased any land, but it was one Bazanna, who showed the land to him in 1993 or 1994 after the demise of his father.  The Respondent thereupon approached the trial court with the following claims:  “a. A declaration that he is the lawful owner of the parcel of land situate at Alidawari village. b. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant by himself or his privy or agent and servant from any act of trespassing in or above the aforesaid land. c. Cost of the suit.\" -" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Respondents as plaintiffs sued the Appellants in Oba Customary Court of Anambra State for a declaration of title to the disputed land and perpetual injunction to restrain the first and second Defendants/Appellants from further trespassing on the land. The Plaintiffs/Respondents' case in the customary Court was that the land in dispute is in Umuogbu Umuogali village, Oba and originally belonged to their grandfather, Mgbeafulukwe. The land was inherited by their fathers and subsequently by them. Their grandfathers Anaso Mgbeafulukwe and Okafor Mgbeafulukwe gave the land part of which is now in dispute to one Ezeukwu, the father of Sampson Ezeukwu of Umuogbu, Umuogali village, Oba for farming purposes only. Sampson Ezeukwu gave portions of the land to his brothers and also to the father of the 1st defendant/appellant for cultivation. When the father of the 1st defendant/appellant died, the 1st defendant/appellant continued to cultivate the land. Sometime in 1994, the Appellant erected survey pillars on the land claiming that the 2nd appellant, Okeke Icheke from Aboji village, Oba, had sold the land to him. That in spite of customary arbitration and other efforts to get the 1st Appellant out of the land, the 1st Appellant persisted in laying claim over the land. The Respondents (as plaintiffs) thereafter instituted this action in the Customary Court, Oba. The 1st defendant/appellant on the other hand claimed that the land in dispute was given to their father Odili by Onuora Nwangwu and Icheke Nwangwu to cultivate on payment of tribute. He cultivated the land until their elder Ezeukwu called him and told him that the land was for sale. He bought the land from the 2nd and 3rd defendants/Appellants and an agreement was prepared. The agreement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit \"M\". The 1st defendant also applied for and was issued a Customary Certificate of Occupancy tendered in evidence as Exhibit \"L\". At the conclusion of trial, the Customary Court delivered its Judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and granted the reliefs sought. The High Court affirmed the judgment of the Customary Court and the defendants/appellants further appealed to the Court of Appeal which also affirmed the trial court’s decision.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The 2nd Respondent was allocated shop No. 53, Wunti Shopping Complex Bauchi through a letter of allocation issued by the 1st Respondent (Ministry of Housing, Environment, Bauchi State) dated 3rd February, 2005. Therein, the 2nd Respondent was to pay a total sum of N600,000.00 to the 1st Respondent through Yankari Saving and Loan Limited. The 2nd Respondent paid and was issued receipts for the said sum by two installments of N500,000.00 and N100,000.00 dated 21st day of February, 2005 and 29th December, 2005 respectively. Consequently, the Yankari Saving and Loan Limited issued to the 2nd Respondent a letter of confirmation of payment which purpose was to authorize the 1st Respondent/Ministry to release the keys of the said shop to the 2nd Respondent.  When the 2nd Respondent presented the letter to the Ministry through the office of the 1st Appellant (Eng. Zabairu Yakubu), who was Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, 2nd Respondent allegedly abused and insulted by the 1st Appellant and possession refused. It emerged that the 1st Appellant/Permanent Secretary had allocated the shop to himself using the name of his son (2nd Respondent) as crony. Instructively, in 2005 when 2nd Respondent came for possession of the shop, neither the Permanent Secretary nor his son had made any payment on the shop. It was only on the 30th day of January, 2007 when the suit by the 2nd Respondent was pending that they made payment. Furthermore, they were only able to produce a certified letter of confirmation of payment dated 9th November, 2010, five years after the 2nd Appellant was issued his.  The trial judge after considering the case entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff:-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  In the High Court of Justice, Rivers State, holden at Port Harcourt (Coram) W. A. Chechey, J, this suit consisting of a claim and counterclaim and predicated mainly on the chieftaincy stool known as Okan-Ama of Ibotirem Town in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State was instituted. The principal issue in the dispute as between 1st Plaintiff/Respondent and 2nd Defendant/Appellant was the question of who between the two parties was the lawful Okan-Ama (traditional head) of Ibotirem. The case proceeded to hearing. The Respondents as plaintiffs called two witnesses and tendered several Exhibits, numbered Exhibit 1 - 33. As can be gleaned from the printed record, repeated adjournments were sought and granted in favour of the Appellants. Subsequently the Appellants, alleging bias on the part of the trial Judge failed to appear in Court in spite of the issuance and service of hearing notice on them. Pursuant to an application made by the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs/Respondents, both the Appellants’ further cross-examination of the Respondents’ witnesses and the defence of the Appellants was foreclosed by the trial Court, because of Respondents’ absence in Court. On the 2nd day of June, 2004, the learned trial Judge delivered his judgment wherein he held thus:- “But I must say that in all my years, I have hardly ever seen a case more thoroughly and uncompromisingly proved. There was nothing unreasonable in the evidence of the Plaintiffs before me; rather there was much persuasion in them.” Consistent with the above holding of the learned trial Judge, judgment was entered in favour of the Plaintiffs/Respondents and all the five reliefs claimed by them were granted.-" ;

After the SDP’s nomination primary for the 2019 Gubernatorial elections in 2018, the Appellant as Plaintiff claimed, via an originating summons before a High Court, for several reliefs including two declarations, to wit: that the 2nd Defendant having not participated in the primary election of SDP’ for the 2019 general election cannot have his name submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC as SDP’s governorship candidate for the general election and therefore any purported selection, nomination of the 2nd Defendant as the governorship candidate of their Party for the 2019 general election was illegal, invalid, null, void and of no effect. Appellant/Plaintiff also sought several orders from the Court including an order mandating the Party INEC to submit the name of the plaintiff as the governorship candidate of the Party for the 2019 General Election. The Respondents filed various preliminary objections as to the competence of the originating summons which were overruled.-" ;

Because the Learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take the trial, it ordered the remand of the Respondent in the Prison, and for the case file to be sent to the Director Public Prosecution (DPP), for advice/further action.

Mgbenulu Esq (who appeared for the Respondent at the Magistrate Court), however, opposed the appearance of K.A. Nwakuche Esq for the Commissioner of Police (Appellant) at the High Court, saying that the fiat issued to the Appellants Counsel by the Hon. Attorney General was to prosecute the charge at the Magistrates Court and did not extend to prosecute this case in the High Court; that the fiat was in respect of the matter at the Magistrates Court in Charge No MUB/6C/2018.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary " FACTS The appeal is against the judgment delivered on 20/6/2005, by the High Court of Justice, Owerri Judicial Division where the Appellant was the 3rd accused person in Charge No. HOW/ART/21/99. The Appellant along with three others were charged with the offence of armed robbery contrary to Section 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap. 398, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 1990. They were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry and money totaling N260,715.00, on 17/3/1998 at Mgbee along OrluUrualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. They were arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charges read. The prosecution called 6 witnesses in the proof of its case while the Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified on their own behalf, and called no other witness. In its judgment, the Lower Court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons (Appellant inclusive) in their evidence denied the charge. The Lower Court, after an extensive review and evaluation of the evidence placed before it found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons beyond reasonable doubt and duly sentenced each of them to death. (The 4th accused person in the charge, having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.) It is from that conviction and sentence that this appeal was brought to the Court of Appeal.-" ;

The trial court established that –  1.the 2nd Respondent/Driver drove the 1st Respondent’s bus in the course of his employment with the Transportation company on the dates in question.  2.that the assault and battery incident was perpetrated by the 2nd Defendant against the Plaintiff inside the said bus that belonged to the 1st Defendant, whilst the 2nd Defendant was driving the same from Abuja to Lagos on the dates in question, in the course of his employment. However, the trial court also found that -  1.the conditions of employment of employees of the 1st Defendant specifically forbid them from engaging in a fight or open quarrel during duty hours  2.the 2nd Defendant/driver acted contrary to the terms and conditions of his employment, by attacking the Plaintiff, although his wrong and unauthorized actions were carried out in the course of his employment. The trial Court therefore ruled against the Plaintiff and dismissed their case. -" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellant's statutory Right of Occupancy (R of O), the grant of which was evidenced by the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) No. DG 00104/2007 registered in the Lands Registry office, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, was revoked and the revocation was published in the Ekiti State Government (1st Respondent's) official Gazette No. 1, Vol. 20 of 20th October, 2016. The Appellant, as the Plaintiff at State High Court, sitting at Ado Ekiti, challenged the revocation contending, inter alia, that the revocation was illegal, unconstitutional and a nullity and that it be declared that he remained vested with the R of O over the disputed land - the same having neither been extinguished nor in anyway affected in law by the purported revocation. He also sought a declaration that the subsequent re-allocation of the disputed plot of land to the 4th Respondent, a neighbor and alleged encroacher upon the land - who allegedly actively instigated the revocation of the Appellant's R of O, was illegal, unlawful and a nullity. The Appellant further sought a perpetual injunctive order to restrain the 1st - 3rd Defendants/Respondents from issuing any C of O to the 4th Respondent and/or restraining the 4th Defendant/Respondent from howsoever interfering with his structures built on the land. In the ALTERNATIVE claims, the Appellant sought a declaration that he was in no way in default or breach of any term, condition or obligation in the C of O for the grant of the R of O. The Appellant's Statement of Claim at the trial Court was specially endorsed on the writ of summons taken out on 16th January, 2017.  The Respondents, as Defendants, had by way of demurrer, contrary to Order 22 Rules 1 & 2 of the Ekiti State High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, filed Notices of Preliminary Objection on 1st February, 2017 supported by affidavits contending that the trial High Court lacked \"jurisdiction to entertain this action and pray(s) that the suit be struck out in limine\". The 1st - 3rd Respondents filed a joint Notice of preliminary objection, independent of the 4th Respondent predicated on the grounds that the suit - i. was \"statute barred having been brought outside of the three months period stipulated by Section 2 of the Public Officers Protection Act as the 1st to 3rd Defendants/Appellants issued the Claimant with notice of revocation via letter dated 16th December, 2014 on the ground that the Claimant breached Paragraph 4 of the Certificate of Occupancy. ii. disclosed no reasonable cause of action. In the supporting affidavit, particularly paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 thereof, the 1st - 3rd Respondents founded justification for their revoking the Appellant's R of O on the grounds that the Appellant had serially breached and violated the terms and conditions in the C of O under which the R of O was granted; that the Appellant, instead of paying ground rents, \"appealed for waiver which was not granted\" and was thereby in breach of paragraph 12(ii) of the C of O - Exhibit C. They further alleged that the Appellant was in breach of paragraph 4 of the C of O that enjoined the Appellant to erect and complete buildings in accordance with the approved building plans within two years. They admitted that the Appellant had merely built a perimeter fence round the disputed land. The Appellant opposed the Notices of Preliminary Objections.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The Appellants filed an Originating Summons as Plaintiffs against 1st-3rd Respondents as Defendants seeking the following reliefs:- 1. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 1st Defendant is not statutorily qualified to stand election as a candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 Election. 2. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination of the 1st Defendant by the 2nd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 3. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendant's name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election having violated the provisions of Section 31 (5) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. 4. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal and purported nomination and submission of the 1st Defendants name by the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as its candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 5. An order of the Honourable Court setting aside the illegal recognition and publication of the 1st Defendant's name by the 3rd Defendant as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 6. A declaration of the Honourable Court that the 2nd Plaintiff is the validly nominated candidate of the 2nd Defendant's candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 7. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st Defendant from campaigning and parading himself as the 2nd Defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. 8. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the 3rd Defendant by itself, any of its officials, or people working for and through them from further recognizing the 1st Defendant as the 2nd defendant's candidate for candidate for the Anambra East and West Federal Constituency in the 2019 General Election. (found at pages 1 to 4 of the record of appeal). Upon being served the Originating Summons, all the respondents filed memoranda of conditional appearances as they felt the appellants who did not take part in the primaries had no locus standi to institute the action. They however followed it up with the filing of their respective counter affidavits.  The 1st and 2nd Respondents also filed preliminary objection whereunder the judgment in suit No. OT/194/2018 delivered by Amaechina, J. of the Otuocha Judicial Division, Anambra State High Court of Justice was referenced and exhibited. It was contended for the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the aforesaid judgment of the Otuocha High Court had found that the alleged false information on age declaration was not proved and that the 1st Respondent was qualified to contest the subject election. The 1st Respondent contended in his defence that the judgment in suit No. OT/194/2018 was a judgment in rem which binds the Appellants even though they were not parties to the action leading to the judgment. The 2nd Respondent on its part raised the point in its Notice of Preliminary Objection that suit No. FHC/AWK/CS/148/2018 was an abuse of Court process. The 2nd Respondent further contended that the originating summons filed by the Appellants was not endorsed as mandatorily required by the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and that the said originating summons was therefore incompetent. The trial Court heard all the objections together with the main matter and on 6th February, 2019, delivered Ruling on the Defendant's (now Respondents) preliminary objections on pages 630 - 631 of the Record of Appeal, the learned Trial Judge held as follows:- \"No matter how one chooses to compare the two suits, their basic similarities are unmistakable. The arrow head in both suits is the 2nd defendant in this suit. The reliefs sought herein are the same in thrust with those in the earlier suit. In my considered view, this suit constitutes a clear abuse of Court processes. It is liable to be dismissed. Having thus held, it becomes unnecessary to proceed into any other or further determination herein. This suit is accordingly hereby dismissed.\" Dissatisfied with the above decision by the learned trial Judge, the Appellants filed Notice of Appeal against the said judgment at the Court of Appeal.-" ;

He was alleged to have raped the PW3 who was on an errand for her mother along with PW1. The Appellant came on a motorcycle, picked the PW3, held her with one hand and drove away with her. He drove around with her despite her cries. At one point, he stopped and somebody came with a machete and asked why she was crying. The Appellant told the person to forget about her. Then the Appellant took her behind a filling station, pushed her to the ground and had an illicit sexual intercourse with the PW3. The Appellant then put her back on the motorcycle, brought her to a roundabout and when he saw her mother (PW2) and some other people, he pushed her off, threw Four Hundred Naira (N400) on her and rode off. PW3’s mother and those with her lifted the PW3 from the ground and took her to the police station where she gave her statement. When arrested, Appellant first made a statement denying the intercourse but admitting driving her around at her request. Thereafter, he made another statement denying the making of the first statement.-" ;

In the particulars of offence, the Appellant and the 3 other accused persons and other still at large - while armed with firearms - were alleged to have robbed one John Nwokeocha and his passengers of one Mercedes Benz 911 Lorry with Registration No. AE 281 and money totaling N260,715.00, on 17/3/1998 at Mgbee along OrluUrualla-Akaokwa Road in Orlu Judicial Division. The charge was read over to the accused persons including the Appellant on 10/8/1999, and each of them pleaded not guilty thereto.  The prosecution called 6 witnesses in proof of its case against the Appellant and the other accused persons. The Appellant and each of the other accused persons, testified on their own behalf, and called no witness.  In its judgment, the trial court noted that the 1st accused person in the charge before it, namely John Okorie confessed to the crime and that the other accused persons (Appellant inclusive) in their evidence denied the charge. The Court found the prosecution to have proved its case against the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons but not in respect of the 4th accused person. Hence, the Court convicted the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons of the offence preferred against them and sentenced the Appellant and 2 of the other accused persons to death as mandated by the law under which they were charged. The 4th accused person in the charge, having been found not guilty, was acquitted and discharged.-" ;

They were alleged to have used a toy gun to attack and rob a motorcycle rider and his passenger, and dispossessed them of the sum of N500 and N1,500 respectively. At the trial, the Prosecution called a sole Witness, Friday Ojiemen, a Policeman attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), lkeja, and he tendered the Statement made by the Appellant to the Police. However, Defence Counsel objected to the admissibility of the said Statement in evidence because \"the Defendant denied writing the Statement, the Defendant alleged duress in obtaining the Statement.\" In the circumstances, the trial Court conducted a trial-within-trial, and after its Ruling of 20/4/2012 wherein the Appellant's confessional Statement was admitted in evidence as Exhibit P2, it adjourned the matter to ''6th, 12th and 13th of June 2012\", for continuation of the trial. After a series of adjournments, mostly at the instance of the Accused, the trial Court, in its Judgment of 1/4/2014, found him guilty as charged, and convicted and sentenced him to 21 years imprisonment.-" ;

The motion was couched thus:  1) For leave to file and argue fresh issues of customary law not raised at the Court below; and 2) Deeming the fresh issues of customary law contained in the notice of appeal, dated 15th day of September (sic) already filed and served, as having been properly filed and served. The motion arose from an appeal brought by the applicant against the decision of a Customary Court of Appeal upholding the decision of a Customary Court which awarded title over a set of contested land tracts to the respondent. However, on close inspection, the motion was exposed as one seeking to introduce and argue fresh issues bordering on the evaluation of evidence by the trial Customary Court and an issue of customary law not canvassed before the Customary of Appeal thereby allowing that Court to give a decision thereon.-" ;

    lexlegal:hasSummary "  ORIGINATING FACTS AND CLAIMS  The respondent sued the appellant vide an Amended originating Motion seeking among others the following reliefs: 1.A declaration that the arrest, detention, restriction/confinement and continuing detention of the Applicant by the EFCC was unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and violation of the Applicant's fundamental rights guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 2.A Declaration that the refusal to release the Applicant until he admits laundering undisclosed amount of money or any sum whatsoever is unlawful, unconstitutional, illegal and a violation of the Applicant's Fundamental Rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. 3. An Order of injunction restraining the EFCC from violating or further violating the fundamental rights of the Applicant as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. 4. An order for the sum of Two Billion Naira (2,000,000,000) only as exemplary and aggravated damages for the infraction of the Applicant's fundamental rights. 5. An Order of Court for the release of the Applicant from custody of the EFCC; directing the EFCC to tender a public apology to the Applicant; immediate release of the Applicant's international passport confiscated by the EFCC. Upon being served with the process, the EFCC raised a preliminary objection to the hearing of the originating process on the grounds that the original originating motion was not served on it; and that the respondent failed to comply with the provisions of the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement procedure) Rules (FREP), 2009 relating to the mode of commencement of an action. In defence of the substantive application, the EFCC, filed a counter affidavit wherein it denied detaining the respondent or confiscating his international passport.  After listening to the parties, the trial Court, in a reserved judgment dismissed the EFCC’s preliminary objections and entered judgment in the substantive suit in the respondent's favour. It found and held that the EFCC unlawfully detained the respondent in its custody and also confiscated his international passport. The Court awarded N10 million (Ten Million Naira) as damages in favour of the respondent and against the appellant for unlawful detention.-" ;
